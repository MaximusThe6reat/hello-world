Fork: Copying a remote repository to another remote repository on your account

Branch: different versions of the same project 
  - master should aways be functional
  - other branches can be edited without messing up main branch
  
  
commit - you essentially save changes to your local repository on your machine


push - push your commits to the branch


pull - pull new updates of whatever branch you are on to your local repository


pull request - you can merge your branch with master

steps on local:
1) git remote add origin [link]
2) git branch [other branch]
3) git checkout [other branch]
